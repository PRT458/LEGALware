# LEGALware
An Idea i had to try to create code legal standards in an open source non governmental manner creating a infinite number of possible licenses.

My main objective is to establish a non-governmental organization with open-source characteristics to standardize the legal protection of code globally. We aspire to create a platform that simplifies legal and financial processes associated with any code in any programming language. In pursuit of this goal, we aim to develop standards applicable to a wide range of programming languages. Additionally, we plan to establish exceptions and special rules for languages that do not align with these standards. Furthermore, we seek to formulate a classification system that prioritizes the working principles of code as the primary definition of intellectual property.

Definition of different code.

Different code isn't defined by its appearance but rather by how it interacts with all software or hardware elements. Therefore, even if another piece of code is written in a different programming language and doesn't share many similarities with other code, it should be considered virtually the same if it attempts to copy or emulate the principles of the working of another code. Keep in mind that this does not imply that attempting to simulate another code should make yours identical. However, trying to achieve this with the same inner workings, regardless of programming language or hardware use, should be the focus.
